# Hello World! I'm [Tapaswi Satyapanthi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tapaswi-v-s/)


I’m a Data Enthusiast with a solid foundation in software engineering. After spending 4 years building robust software solutions, I ventured into the world of Data Science and AI in 2022, where I discovered that models could do more than just answer questions—they could turn raw data into insightful narratives and create experiences that feel almost magical.

Today, I’m expanding my expertise at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), diving deep into Generative AI, ML models, Neural Networks, and Data Engineering. 

### My mission now? 
To blend my software engineering skills with the power of LLMs and advanced models, crafting cutting-edge applications and systems that push the boundaries of what’s possible with data.
